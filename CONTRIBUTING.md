# Contributing to can-rrsp-cashout

1. Make sure there's an existing [issue](https://github.com/danielabar/can-rrsp-cashout/issues) in the project for the work you're about to start. The issue should be focused on just one thing.
2. After forking the repo, create a branch named `feature/issuenumber-shortdesc` or `bugfix/issuenumber-shortdesc`.
3. Keep commits small-ish, commit messages should reference the ticket number, for example with hash symbol, for example `[#17] Description of what was changed`.
4. Maintain or add new tests as needed. Test files are located in the same folder as the source. For example, file `lib/calc-util.js` has corresponding `lib/calc-util.test.js`.
